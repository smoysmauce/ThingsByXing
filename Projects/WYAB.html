                  <p style="font-weight: 500; color: grey;">I compiled several reviews from similar mobile apps and analysed customer needs and common pain points. Two separate questionnaires were also distributed to gain an understanding on how people viewed air pollution.</p>

                  <p style="font-weight: 500; color: grey;">I was involved extensively in the entire process of shaping the webapp, from establishing the idea based on our research, to sketching and prototyping on Figma. We employed several methods in our user testing, such as the system usability scale and informal interviews. The insights gained were synthesised and applied into further iterations. </p>

                  <p style="font-weight: 500; color: grey;">All scenes in the webapp were constructed by myself with help from the Unity Asset store and my partner. This includes several of the animations within the scene, logos and backgrounds, as well as the layout of the interface.</p>

              <h2 class="display-3 mb-4">The Problem</h2>
              <p class="lead mr-4" style="font-weight: 400;">The issue of air pollution misinformation is largely ignored due to people’s misconception of it as a non-urgent problem that won’t affect their health and the environment. As the Internet has now become a major part of our everyday digital lives - and is not something kept separate or apart - individuals can’t distinguish between what is factual and how this global issue in fact directly affects everyone including the environment.

              <h2 class="display-3 mb-4" >Our Solution</h2>
              <p class="lead mb-4" style="font-weight: 400;">We conceptualised and created a web application focused on providing qualitative information in the form of a city simulation, where the air pollution is visualised. As the user interacts with the application, they can understand how air pollution affects countries of varying economic statuses and populations, and gain an informed understanding on the topic.</p>

        <div class="container py-5">
          <h1 class="pt-2" style="color: #6187AB;">1. Discover</h1>
          <p class="lead m-4" style="font-weight: 400;">To understand the issue at hand, thorough research into the public's perception of air pollution was required. We conducted <strong>background research using internet articles and papers</strong>, conducted <strong>market analysis on four mobile apps</strong> similarly dealing with the issue and sent out <strong>two questionnaires</strong>, which receved a total of 38 responses.</p>

          <div class="container py-3">
            <h3 class="pt-2">Background Research</h3>
            <p class="lead mb-4" style="font-weight: 400;">Our background research revealed that air pollution accounts for an estimated 7 million premature deaths around the world each year (IQair, 2020), and that long-term exposure is capable of increasing heart disease and asthma, along with being a significant cause of lung cancer (Mansouri, 2016). Air pollution resulting from anthropogenic causes specifically impacts both the geographical distribution of diseases as well as natural disasters (such as heat waves, melting glaciers), posing as a significant threat to humanity if not properly addressed through public awareness (Manisalidis, 2020).</p>
            <p class="lead mb-4" style="font-weight: 600;">However, a deeper probe into the attitudes surrounding this matter also revealed that society is constantly being misinformed by those in political power as well as by large corporations whom individuals have a tendency to trust</p>
          </div>

          <div class="container py-3">
            <h3 class="pt-2">Questionnaires</h3>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-lg-6 order-2 order-lg-1">
                <p class="lead mb-4" style="font-weight: 400;">This understanding of misinformation was clearly evident and supported by our user research. From our two questionnaires, we analysed both qualitative and quantitative data using an affinity diagram and discovered four key insights:
                </p>
                <ul class="lead mb-4" style="font-weight: 400;">
                  <li>Many don't understand why air pollution is bad</li>
                  <li>Individuals become more aware when directly affected by air pollution</li>
                  <li>People deflect responsibility of air pollution to bigger bodies</li>
                  <li>Lack of trust in governmental information</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <div class="col-lg-6 order-1 order-lg-2"><img src="/images/WYAB/WAYB User Research Insights.png" alt=""><p class="lead text-muted ml-4">All findings were collated into an affinity diagram on Miro</p></div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="container py-3">
            <h3 class="pt-2">Market Analysis</h3>
            <p class="lead mb-4" style="font-weight: 400;">Further market analysis on air pollution applications was conducted to understand what currently works and doesn’t work. Covering reviews from varying apps that provided AQI (Air Quality Index) data, such as AirVisual and Weatherbug, it was found that these apps focused purely on providing statistical data, with little done to educate its users beyond that. Although they fulfil their purpose as data-providing apps, their incredibly basic interface created a severe lack of emotion and air pollution was totally omitted as an urgent matter.</p>
          </div>

        </div>

          <div class="container py-5">
            <h1 class="pt-2" style="color: #6187AB;">2. Define</h1>
            <p class="lead m-4" style="font-weight: 400;">In order to fully synthesize the findings gained, a thematic analysis on all key insights was conducted. Findings were written on sticky notes, with separate colours denoting the areas in which they were discovered, then grouped into similar themes. From these themes, the “How might we” framework was applied, to establish each theme set as design problems that would appropriately inform and shape potential solutions.</p>

          <div class="container py-5">
            <h1 class="pt-2" style="color: #6187AB;">3. Develop</h1>
            <h3 class="pt-4">Initial Concepts and Sketches</h3>
            <p class="lead mt-4" style="font-weight: 400;">As a team, we then began ideating a number of concepts before narrowing in on a select few and <strong>creating user flows, personas, and storyboards </strong> to define user requirements. We felt that the concepts we came up with had enough breadth for us to experiment with a variety of ideas and interactions to help later inform our design choices for our final evolved chosen concept.</p>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
                <img src="/images/WYAB/Concept 1.png" alt="Concept 1">

              </div>
            </div>
            <p class="lead m-4" style="font-weight: 400;">By testing, Concept 1 and Concept 2 using a decision matrix we wanted to discover whether users preferred a quick immersive experience using filters or a more in-depth illustrative approach through story-telling.</p> 
            <p class="lead m-4" style="font-weight: 400;">However, both these concepts lacked in evoking the necessary emotional responses that would create an impact and shift people’s perspectives about air pollution awareness so we continued to expand our ideas. We then amalgamated the best features of both concepts which evolved into the beginning of our Final Concept WAYB.</p>
