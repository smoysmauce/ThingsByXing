        <p>The concept of this project was inspired by a reddit post I discovered online which portrayed the pattern created by the Earth and Venus in their separate orbits around the Sun. The first stage 
          of my assignment was to replicate this pattern, which involved programming two ellipses to circle around a focal point whilst utilizing an array to store the co-ordinates of ellipses in order to 
          draw static lines between them. I researched the number of days it would take Venus to do a full rotation around the Sun, which was 225, in comparison to Earth’s year of 365 days.
          Although I planned to implement these aspects into my code to stay faithful to the original source, ultimately, I did not due to wanting to experiment more with the visual concept rather than to be constrained by its scientific purpose.</p>
          <p>Upon finalizing the base concept of my project, I noticed that the pattern bore a striking resemblance to some of the nail string artworks I created in primary school, as well as mandalas, spiritual symbols often portrayed in Buddhist and Hindu religion. Both of these understandings ultimately inspired me to add further elements to propel my initial concept into something more than a simple replica of a scientific gif.</p>
          <p>The nail string aspect of the code prompted me to investigate some of the designs on www.guidepatterns.com, taking interest in a few of the arrangements This encouraged me to experiment with the speed at which I programmed the orbs to run, which allowed me to create different patterns. The pattern in my final product is the one that visually appealed to me the most, after experimenting with several. </p>
          <p>The mandala aspect of the code inspired me to add more ‘layers’ to my pattern, which involved adding two more circulating orbs. As the base structure for the code was already in place, implementing more orbs was a much simpler task. This allowed me to experiment with more speeds and patterns, as well as a variety of floral-like designs prevalent in mandalas. Finally, I decided to add colours to the strings, which would complete the mesmerizing qualities of the dynamic composition, the randomness of each set of colours allowing the design to be viewed in a plethora of ways. </p>
          <p>The final product of my project aims to capture the simple charm of nail string arrangements and the intricacy of mandalas, all whilst remaining within the conceptual confines of the fascinating design created by the concept of planets orbiting the sun.</p>
